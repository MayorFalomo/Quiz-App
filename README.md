## Optimizations

I needed my web application to be fast so i used Next Js which is known for it's speed.

I avoided making too many API Calls and instead used Redux to pass and update my states and avoid re-renders throughout my application.

Login is passwordless and one-time.

i made sure Components were reusable so i didn't have to build too many components from scratch.

All useEffects have a dependency Array, so there's no chance of your browser crashing from too many repeated API calls.
